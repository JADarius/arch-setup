# Arch post-installation minimalist setup
 This is a repository in which I put all my configs and the setup script that I use after installing Arch Linux. After running the script, a dwm Xorg system will be available.

## Usage
This setup assumes you have an AMD Graphics Card. For other cards check the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xorg#Driver_installation).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jadarius/arch-setup.git
cd arch-setup
./setup.sh
```
